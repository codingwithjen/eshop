# Step Two: Project Proposal

For Capstone #2, I want to build a *******simple******* e-Commerce storefront to mock up the buying and selling of products on an online service, similar to an Amazon storefront, or anything specialized, such as groceries, shoes, furniture, etc.

## UI and/or Template Features:

- **Navigational Components**
    - Shopping cart checkout feature
        - View shopping cart and update items and amount if the shopping cart slides to the right of page, or if itâ€™s a popup
        - Search field
        - Pagination or breadcrumbs
        - Sliders and image carousels
- **Input Controls**
    - Dropdown lists or buttons
    - Update quantities of product
- **Informational Components**
    - Notifications
        - Cart items updated
    - Progress bars at checkout
    - Message boxes
    - Modal windows (pop-ups)

## Expected Features
